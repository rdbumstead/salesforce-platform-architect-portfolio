# ADR-005: Gamified Testimonial UI

## Status

Accepted

## Context

Need to balance professional verification with the candidate's personal brand personality.

## Decision

Implement a "Vibe-Gated" Sentence Builder (Mad-Libs style) UI.

## Rationale

Ensures structured data entry while providing a unique, engaging experience for visitors.

## Implications

Requires custom LWC logic to handle dynamic sentence fragments and "Vibe" toggles.
