Project: Salesforce Platform Architect Portfolio

Version: 1.0

Owner: Ryan Bumstead

Date: MVP – Q1 2026

## Strategic Intent

This Program Charter defines the strategic intent and delivery plan for the Salesforce Platform Architect Portfolio. It serves as the authoritative reference for project scope, business value, and timeline.

## Business Value: Why Build This Complexity?

The primary problem this portfolio solves is that Recruiters and Hiring Managers struggle to verify an architect's hands-on skills through static PDFs.

- **The Need:** A verified, interactive demonstration of complex capabilities like API design, LWC, and AI.
- **The Value:** This system intentionally mirrors a real enterprise architecture so evaluators can see architecture quality, integration patterns, DevOps discipline, and multi-cloud strategy — all within a controlled, demonstrable environment. It proves that "Enterprise Grade" is a mindset, not just a license tier.
